# WELCOME TO MI PROFILE! 👋

### 👋 Hi, my name is Jose.  
I am from Spain and I love computing ❤💻.  
From a very young age I have been very interested in this world and everything that can be built with it.  
Every day that passes is an opportunity to learn something new.  
Don't let him get away! 

### I am a web and multiplatform developer.

This is my official repository!
Here I will upload my projects so that people can see and share them.
The programming languages I have used to date have been java, php, html, css, and JavaScript.
I have also used Mysql and Firebase.
